# libcap-ng
The libcap-ng library should make programming with posix capabilities
easier. The library has some utilities to help you analyse a system
for apps that may have too much privileges. It also comes with python
bindings. However, printing capabilities from python does not work. But
you can still manipulate capabilities, though.
